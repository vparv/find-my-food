# FindMyFood

Restaurant recommendation system utilizing price and distance as key criteria

Visit the project at https://findmyfood.netlify.app/. You must first allow temporary access to a demo server on https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/, this allows us to utilize the Yelp Fusion API which powers our application information. Please allow your location to be shared and wait 5 seconds (a buffer put in to allow you to select your location) for the results to show up. Thanks for checking this project out!

TODOs:
1. Add cards via Deck.js and Card.js
2. Yelp Integration
3. Distance/price/reviews
4. Card dynamics
